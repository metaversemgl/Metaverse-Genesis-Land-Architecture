# Metaverse-Genesis-Land-Architecture
 you are the creator of your land and the limit of your land is in your imagination.
There are no restrictions on your Genesis architecture.
Genesis has prepared a tool for you to do all the necessary work on your land.
You can:
Track land ownership and content.
You can transfer your ownership to another.
You can download all your assets and transfer them to another land.
You can download all your assets and transfer them to another network.
You can have users on your land and set rules for them.
Land ownership in Genesis is at the level of consensus, where the content of the land is created. 
For the security of your land, the content of the files is hashed so that when the content is sent and received, by checking its hash, you will realize that the content of your land has not changed.
All we try to do in Genesis is run a network so that you have a strong experience of the virtual reality world. 
In Genesis architecture, all users can have an identity at the request of the owner and be authenticated to enter your land.
There are no restrictions here; Genesis is your world
